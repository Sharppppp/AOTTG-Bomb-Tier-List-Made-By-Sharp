            <h1>How Does The Calculation Work?</h1>
            <section id="rank-multiplier">
                <h2>Rank Multiplier Calculation:</h2>
                <p>Each rank (E, D, C, B, A, S, SS, X) is assigned an index.</p>
                <p>The difference in rank indices between two players is calculated.</p>
                <p>The rank multiplier is derived from this difference plus one.</p>
                <p>For example if a SS player plays against an A player then the rank multiplier is 3 because of the 2 difference + 1</p>
            </section>
        
            <section id="score-calculation">
                <h2>Score Calculation:</h2>
                <p>If both players have the same rank, their duel scores are adjusted based on the ratio of their scores.</p>
                <p>If players have different ranks, the rank multiplier affects the score adjustments. Winning against a higher-ranked player gives a larger score boost, while losing to a lower-ranked player results in a greater score penalty.</p>

                <h2>Duel Outcome:</h2>
                <p>Wins, losses, and draws are recorded for each player.</p>
                <p>Duel scores are adjusted based on the match results and rank multiplier.</p>
