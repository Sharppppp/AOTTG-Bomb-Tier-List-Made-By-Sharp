                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                <p>This is a Bomb tier list where I ranked each player based on their different abilities such as speed, endurance, tactical thinking, and more. Please note that this list is made by me and represents my opinion. However, I put a lot of effort into it, so you might find it quite accurate! This list was made without any emotional biasâ€”just raw, objective assessments.</p>
